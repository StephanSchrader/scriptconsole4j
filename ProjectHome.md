# Project goal #
Providing an easy-to-use embeddable multi-language scripting console for Java 6 applications.
# How? #
The JSR 223 (Scripting for the JavaTM Platform) standardizes the usage of scripting in Java.
Java 6 already ships with built-in support for JavaScript (Rhino).
Java applications can take advantage of our project to instantiate and utilize this easy to embbed scripting panel which enables to use any JSR 223 compliant scripting engine available in the runtime environment.
# Is it really useful? #
Well, at least it was for me...I could, for example, execute ad-hoc method calls on live objects from inside my application during runtime.
# Scripting in OSGi #
Check the OSGi bundle in the downloads section. It enables adhoc scripting accessing the OSGi framework.
